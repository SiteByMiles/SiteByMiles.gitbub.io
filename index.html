        <h2>My Skills!</h2> 
    <p>In my experience in ATM, I feel like some of my skills are coding, as well as typing, and creating and editing pictures. I can create visual projects of classrooms and can even create my own logo.

     <div><img src="images/Baseball.png" width="450"></div>
    <p>In my free time, some things you can catch me doing is playing baseball, chilling with my friends, watching youtube, playing video games, and more. For me, baseball is my key sport. I practice from Monday through Friday, and I have games on the weekends. I really enjoy the sport</p>
    <h2>My family!</h2> 
    <p>I have 6 people in my family, who I live with. I have two other siblings, a brother who is 15, and a sister who is 10. Iâ€™m the middle child, because being the middle child is the best. I live with my siblings, as well as my mom and dad, including my grandma. Me and my siblings are from Atlanta Georgia, and my mom is from alabama. In the Hughes household, we try to make everything fun!</p>
