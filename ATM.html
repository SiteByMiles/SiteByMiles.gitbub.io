     <div><img src="images/Metal.png" width="450" alt="Big University"></div>
    <p>For college, I would like to attend the University of Stanford. I chose this because I’ve researched Stanford, and found very positive things about it. I've also had some famiy that also have attended the University of Stanford. Its a great school overall, with great academics as well as great sports.</p>
    <h2>Career Interest</h2> 
    <p>As I get older, I would like to have a successful career. I want to become a major league baseball player. This career, you can earn a lot of money. I think this will be a perfect career because i’m very good at the sport.But I do have some back up careers like working at a buisiness, becoming a teacher, sports coaching, and more. Careers will help me shape my life, and help me live the life I want to live.</p>
