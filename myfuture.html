        <h2>High School</h2> 
    <p>Right now, my choices for high school are Lakewood, Millikan, and Bosco. I chose lakewood for a choice because I wanted to be with my brother, and It has good baseball. I chose Millikan because a lot of my friends are going there, and they have great programs. Finally, I chose Bosco, because it has great academics, and it was the second ranked baseball school in the country.

    <p>For college, I would like to attend the University of Stanford. I chose this because I’ve researched Stanford, and found very positive things about it. I've also had some famiy that also have attended the University of Stanford. Its a great school overall, with great academics as well as great sports.</p>
    <h2>My family!</h2> 
    <p>I have 6 people in my family, who I live with. I have two other siblings, a brother who is 15, and a sister who is 10. I’m the middle child, because being the middle child is the best. I live with my siblings, as well as my mom and dad, including my grandma. Me and my siblings are from Atlanta Georgia, and my mom is from alabama. In the Hughes household, we try to make everything fun!</p>
